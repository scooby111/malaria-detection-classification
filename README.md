# malaria-detection-classification  

This project is aimed at developing a web tool that will allow researchers to automatically detect cells with malaria parasite and quantify number of parasitized erythrocytes. Importantly, it is able to identify the developmental stage of the parasite (P. _falsiparum_), which has not been done before and only became possible due to the unique dataset that was generated by us. 

## Demo

**Pipeline**    

- Cell segmentation from microscope images using cellpose  
- ROI extarction  
- ROI classification using finetuned Resnet18  

Streamlit was used to create the web app, which was then deployed to Heroku.
